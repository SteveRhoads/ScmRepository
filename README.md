# ScmRepository
Creating a Rally Scm Repository with Ruby
We're going to:

1) Create a connection to Rally

2) Setup and retrieve a list of existing SCM Repositories for a specified workspace

3) Setup a SCMRepo creation, and then create it

4) Delete a specific SCMRepo (remember that you will lose the associated Changesets as well)
